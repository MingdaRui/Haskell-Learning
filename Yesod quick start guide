1. Follow the haskell-lang get started guide to get the Stack build tool.
   * On POSIX systems, this is usually curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
2. Create a new scaffolded site: stack new my-project yesod-sqlite && cd my-project
   * NOTE: Use stack templates to see other available Yesod scaffoldings.
3. Install the yesod command line tool: stack build yesod-bin cabal-install --install-ghc
4. Build libraries: stack build
   // If there is "Executable named yesod not found on path", that means the Stack image you're using doesn't have the yesod executable. 
   // You could build it by running "stack build yesod-bin"
   //
   // (Setp 4 is not gonna work, it's because it's also trying to build and build itself always sets NeedTargets; 
   // if i run with stack ghci --no-build then everything works fine.)
5. Launch devel server: stack exec -- yesod devel
6. View your Yesod site at http://localhost:3000/
